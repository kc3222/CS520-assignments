You are a careful Python developer.

Write correct, efficient, and readable Python code that solves the problem.

Problem:

Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to milliseconds.

## Example:

```python
past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```

Input constraints: `0 <= h <= 23`, `0 <= m <= 59`, `0 <= s <= 59`

Function name (if you choose a functional solution): past


Starter code (optional to use):

def past(h, m, s):


Examples (input -> expected output):

---
Input:
[0, 1, 1]
Output:
[61000]

---
Input:
[1, 1, 1]
Output:
[3661000]

---
Input:
[0, 0, 0]
Output:
[0]

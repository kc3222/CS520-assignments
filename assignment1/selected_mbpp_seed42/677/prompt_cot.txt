def validity_triangle(a,b,c):
Write a function to check if the triangle is valid or not.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `validity_triangle` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

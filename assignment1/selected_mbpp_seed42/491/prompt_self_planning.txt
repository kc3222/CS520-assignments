def sum_gp(a,n,r):
Write a function to find the sum of geometric progression series.

You are a methodical Python engineer.
Before coding, make a brief plan in your head: inputs/outputs, edge cases, approach, and complexity.
Finally, output ONLY the final Python code implementing `sum_gp` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

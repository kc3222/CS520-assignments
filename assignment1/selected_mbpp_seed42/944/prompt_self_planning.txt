def num_position(text):
Write a function to separate and print the numbers and their position of a given string.

You are a methodical Python engineer.
Before coding, make a brief plan in your head: inputs/outputs, edge cases, approach, and complexity.
Finally, output ONLY the final Python code implementing `num_position` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

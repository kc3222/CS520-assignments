def num_position(text):
Write a function to separate and print the numbers and their position of a given string.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `num_position` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

You are a careful and self-debugging Python developer.

Write a function called `num_position(text)` that separates and prints the numbers and their positions in the given string.

After writing the initial implementation, follow these self-debugging steps:
1. Review the code for potential edge cases (e.g., multiple numbers, no digits, digits mixed in words).
2. Reason through example inputs and expected outputs.
3. Correct any possible logical or indexing mistakes before finalizing the code.

Return only the final corrected Python code implementing `num_position`, with no comments, no print statements, and no test cases.

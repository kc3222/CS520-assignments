def min_val(listval):
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `min_val` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

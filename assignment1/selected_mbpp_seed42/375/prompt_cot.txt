def round_num(n,m):
Write a function to round the given number to the nearest multiple of a specific number.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `round_num` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

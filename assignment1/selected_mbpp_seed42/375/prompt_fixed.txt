def round_num(n,m):
Write a function to round the given number to the nearest multiple of a specific number.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `round_num` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.
Make sure these example pass: 
- round_num(4722,10)==4720
- round_num(219,2)==218
- round_num(4959, 7) == 4956

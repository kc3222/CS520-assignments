You are a careful and self-debugging Python developer.

Write a function called `round_num(n, m)` that rounds the given number `n` to the nearest multiple of a specific number `m`.

After writing the initial implementation, follow these self-debugging steps:
1. Check if the rounding logic correctly handles both upward and downward rounding.
2. Verify behavior for edge cases like exact multiples, negative numbers, and m = 1.
3. Simulate the function with examples to confirm correctness.
4. Fix any potential logical or arithmetic mistakes before finalizing the code.

Return only the final corrected Python code implementing `round_num`, with no comments, no print statements, and no test cases.

def check_type(test_tuple):
Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.

You are a methodical Python engineer.
Before coding, make a brief plan in your head: inputs/outputs, edge cases, approach, and complexity.
Finally, output ONLY the final Python code implementing `check_type` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

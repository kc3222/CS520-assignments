def check_type(test_tuple):
Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.

You are a careful Python developer.
First, reason step by step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code implementing `check_type` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

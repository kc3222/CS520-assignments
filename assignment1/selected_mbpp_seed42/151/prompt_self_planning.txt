def gcd(p,q):
Write a python function to check whether the given number is co-prime or not.

You are a methodical Python engineer.
Before coding, make a brief plan in your head: inputs/outputs, edge cases, approach, and complexity.
Finally, output ONLY the final Python code implementing `is_coprime` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

def max_length(list1):
Write a function to find the list of lists with maximum length.

You are a methodical Python engineer.
Before coding, make a brief plan in your head: inputs/outputs, edge cases, approach, and complexity.
Finally, output ONLY the final Python code implementing `max_length` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.

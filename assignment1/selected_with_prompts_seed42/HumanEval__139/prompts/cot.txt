def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.

First, reason step-by-step privately about the algorithm and tricky cases.
Then, output ONLY valid Python code that implements `special_factorial` â€” no comments, no prints, no tests.
